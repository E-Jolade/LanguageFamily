# LanguageFamily
06/29/30

Program was used as a way to practice both Classes and concepts like Inheritance and Polymorphism. Mutliple objects are created from the Language class and subclasses.
Information is then modified in the main method, and at the very end a menu system was implemented to allow the user to modify any of the information from these objects.
